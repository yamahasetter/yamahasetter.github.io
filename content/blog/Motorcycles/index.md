## Motivation

I have been around motorcyles for most of my life. I got my motorcycle operator permit just weeks after turning 18 and have owned 5 motorcycles since then. As any true enthusiast can tell you, the best part of having a thing is customizing it. In this case, I did not just customize, but actually build from the ground up three independent motorcycles.
