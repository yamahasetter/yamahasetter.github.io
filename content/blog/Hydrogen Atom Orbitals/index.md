## Motivation

One of the major introductory concepts to quantum mechanics is that of the standing wave. It comes in many forms in the introductory lessons, but one of the more profound ones arrives in Schrodinger's Time Depedent Equation:

$i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2 }{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V \Psi$

To a physicist this equation is profound beyond belief, but to a mathematician, this equation is nothing other than the Diffusion Equation with a .
