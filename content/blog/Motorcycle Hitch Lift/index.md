## Motivation
Build a cheap, ultra secure, convienient motorcycle carrier that raises and lowers.

## Methodology
The requirements for this project were as follows:
	- Mount directly to the frame or footpegs of the bike
	- Minimize localized stressors to ensure no stress fractures occur
	- Rear wheels of bike need to be as high as possible to preserve off-road depart angle.
