## Motivation

While designing the drone, I was constantly thinking of all the cool things I could do with it; fly through hoops, do flips, harrass my girlfriend, install a camera with facial recognition autonomous flight and small explosives, but I could also drop things if I had the right doohickey. So I decided to build said doohickey using the smallest servo motor I could find. The only problem was how to get the servo to drop something since it communicates via PWM. This inspired me to make my own PWM.
