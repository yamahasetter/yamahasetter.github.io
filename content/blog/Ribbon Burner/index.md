## Motivation

A friend of mine told me he wanted to start forging knives in his back yard. Having spent a large portion of my youth blacksmithing and another large portion of my young adulthood welding, I had picked up a few novel methods of heating aparatuses from people I had run into over the years. One of these aparatuses was called a "ribbon burner", and I was told that it was the most efficient way to heat a surface well above Curie temperatures. This conversation with my friend initiated me to design my own version of this burner. Unfortunately, I realized that my knowledge of fluid dynamics was insufficient to optimize any design of this project. I have made substantial progress on the project, even attempting a first-run prototype, but it ultimately failed. I will be taking a fluid dynamics course in the near future, and I expect it to contain all of the information I've been looking for in order to finally complete this project.
